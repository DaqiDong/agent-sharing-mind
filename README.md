# An autonomous agent sharing its mind, describing its conscious contents
## Abstract
We enable an autonomous agent sharing its artificial mind to its audiences like humans. This supports the autonomous human robot interactions relying on a cognitive architecture, LIDA, which explains and predicts how minds work and is used as the controllers of intelligent autonomous agents. We argue that LIDA’s cognitive representations and processes may serve as the source of the mind content its agent shares out, autonomously.

We built a LIDA software agent embedding with a new description (sub) model, which enables the agent describing its conscious contents. Through this description, the agent’s mind is more observable so we can understand the agent’s entity, behaviors and intelligence directly.
